There were several tiny releases grabbing things from an internal
project, so they've been coalesced here.

Features:

- Locators
- Filesystem-based long-term storage
- In-memory write lock (directory) for long-term storage
- Basic authentication framework; token-based, so multi-factor auth ready
- Rudimentary tutorial
